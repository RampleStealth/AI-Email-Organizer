# Milestone 1: Gmail connection and synchronization

**Status: Complete historical milestone.**

This document preserves the scope and correctness requirements of the first project milestone. It does not represent the current overall project status and does not include features delivered later. See the [project roadmap](project-roadmap.md) for the current sequence.

## Scope

This release connects one Gmail account, synchronizes a bounded recent metadata window, receives change notifications, and exposes connection health. It does not render a mailbox, mutate Gmail content, or invoke AI.

## Google Cloud setup

1. Configure an OAuth web client with the exact `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`.
2. Request only `gmail.readonly` for this release.
3. Create the Pub/Sub topic named by `GOOGLE_PUBSUB_TOPIC` in the same Google Cloud project as the OAuth client.
4. Grant `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com` publisher access to that topic.
5. Create an authenticated push subscription targeting `/v1/webhooks/gmail`, configured with the `PUBSUB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` and `PUBSUB_PUSH_AUDIENCE` values.
6. Complete Google OAuth consent-screen and sensitive-scope verification requirements before any external launch.

## Sync correctness

- Legacy mailbox watermarks are treated as untrusted. Existing mailbox accounts are reset to pending initial synchronization and must establish a fresh baseline before incremental history processing resumes.
- Gmail `watch` is a trigger only; it is not the source of truth.
- `mailbox_accounts.last_history_id` is a compatibility mirror written only after a successful state commit. It is never a resume checkpoint or baseline source.
- The worker records a notification's history ID as pending, then advances its applied history ID only after the exact Gmail history range has been persisted in the same PostgreSQL transaction. Applied IDs advance monotonically; replaying an equal or older ID cannot regress the checkpoint.
- A newly created sync-state row is empty and pending. Only `beginInitialSync` captures a trusted Gmail baseline. During recovery it clears the applied checkpoint but preserves pending notifications, prior success time, and failure code until the recovery transaction succeeds; the successful commit clears the failure code.
- A mailbox with pending history newer than its applied history remains eligible for another sync pass, including when a competing worker holds the mailbox lease.
- A 404 history gap enqueues a scoped full resync.
- Watch renewal never advances either history checkpoint because doing so could skip mail changes.
- A PostgreSQL advisory lock serializes work per mailbox.
- Job IDs, provider identifiers, and database unique constraints make retries idempotent.
- Periodic reconciliation schedules an incremental sync even when no push notification is received.

## Operations

- Serve the API behind the same public hostname as the web application. In production, route `/v1/*` to the API service through the edge proxy; do not place the API on a different site.
- Renew watches every 12 hours; Gmail watches expire within seven days.
- Alert on watch expiration, last-sync freshness, repeated job failure, queue age, and token refresh failure.
- Do not log tokens, message content, subject lines, snippets, or recipient addresses.
- A transient sync error remains visible through `last_sync_error` while the account remains eligible for retries and reconciliation.

## Data retention

Milestone 1 stores connection state, encrypted refresh tokens, Gmail IDs, headers required for synchronization, labels, timestamps, and audit events. It intentionally does not persist email bodies, attachment contents, or message snippets.
